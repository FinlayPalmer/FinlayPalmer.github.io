            In an effort to improve his skills, Johnathan used the feedback forums. A feature on our app that lets you publicly ask the community for tips and tricks. This feature gives other players a chance to help out by leaving feedback and giving advice to the players looking to improve. This feature helps strengthen the gaming community by bringing all players of different skill levels together to help each other out.
